I am the lead for a growing team of Data Scientists at [Lockheed Martin](https://lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html). I have one of the coolest jobs in the world, allowing me to apply deep learning and machine learning algorithms to business problems in a broad variety of domains. I've recently been focused on NLP, using CNN and LSTM based deep learning models to build end to end NLP pipelines.

I studied physics at The Colorado School of Mines and moved into the field of semiconductor reliability at IBM. In this role I worked with bleeding edge FinFet technologies on Power9 and Z14, focusing on leveraging machine learning to predict reliability failures in eDRAM. I have a MS in Electrical Engineering from UVM, and while I am not rasing my 4 children I enjoy working on my custom smarthome platform built using a Raspberry Pi and ESP8266's.
